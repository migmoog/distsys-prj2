Project 2:

To run this, I have a provided a Makefile.

To run each test case, simply run `make comp<tescase no>` for a specific testcase.
Ex: `make comp3` will run docker-compose-testcase-3.yml

I'm implementing this in rust ðŸ¦€. Borrowing rules may be a little weird but overall the logic should be understandable!
