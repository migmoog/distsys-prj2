Project 2:

To run this, I have a provided [Makefile](Makefile).

I'm implementing this in rust ðŸ¦€
(NOTE: setting up a rust environment for docker is quite complicated. It involves a lot of layer manipulation that I'm not too experienced with. My Dockerfile as it stands is a modified version of a chatgpt request)
